# Rain in Australia - Weather Prediction Project

This project aims to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on past weather data from various locations across Australia. The dataset includes around 10 years of daily weather observations. In this project, we use an **Autoencoder** to reduce the dimensionality of the features and an **XGBoost** classifier to predict the target variable, `RainTomorrow`.

## About the Dataset

### Context
Have you ever wondered if you should carry an umbrella tomorrow? With this dataset, you can predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable `RainTomorrow`.

### Content
The dataset consists of about 10 years of daily weather observations from various locations across Australia. The target variable, `RainTomorrow`, tells us whether it will rain the next day. If the rain for that day was 1mm or more, the column is marked as `Yes`. Otherwise, it is marked as `No`.

### Features:
- **Date**: The date of observation (excluded from the analysis).
- **Location**: The name of the weather station (excluded).
- **Various weather parameters**: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, etc.
- **RainToday**: A binary flag indicating whether it rained today.
- **RainTomorrow**: The target variable (Yes/No).

### Source & Acknowledgements
The observations were gathered from a multitude of weather stations. You can access daily observations from the Bureau of Meteorology's website: [Bureau of Meteorology - Climate Data Online](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data).

## Project Overview

This project uses an **Autoencoder** to reduce the dimensionality of the weather data and then applies an **XGBoost** classifier to predict whether it will rain tomorrow (`RainTomorrow`).

### Steps Involved:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Dropped irrelevant columns like `Date`, `Location`, and wind direction columns.
   - Handled missing data by removing rows with missing values.
   - Converted categorical variables (`RainToday` and `RainTomorrow`) into binary values (0 or 1).

2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Used an **Autoencoder** built with PyTorch to reduce the input data's dimensionality from its original size to 5 features. The autoencoder compresses the data, learning an efficient representation.

3. **Classification with XGBoost**:
   - Trained an **XGBoost classifier** on the encoded features generated by the Autoencoder.
   - Handled imbalanced data by adjusting `scale_pos_weight` for the `XGBClassifier`.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The model's performance was evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
