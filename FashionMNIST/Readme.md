# Evaluating Machine Learning Models on the Fashion MNIST Dataset

## Abstract
This study evaluated various machine learning models for classifying the **Fashion MNIST** dataset. The **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** achieved the highest accuracy of **92%**, outperforming **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Random Forests**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. While KNN provided a simple baseline, Random Forests improved robustness and generalization. SVMs offered precise decision boundaries, but CNNs excelled by automatically learning hierarchical features. Although CNNs require more computational resources and training time, their superior performance highlights the potential of deep learning in fashion item recognition.

## Introduction
The Fashion MNIST dataset is a popular benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items categorized into 10 classes. This study aims to evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning models in accurately classifying these fashion items.

## Dataset
- **Fashion MNIST**: The dataset contains 70,000 images of fashion items, split into 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples. Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale, representing different clothing categories such as t-shirts, trousers, and shoes.

## Methodology
The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple baseline model that classifies images based on the majority class among the nearest neighbors.
2. **Random Forests**: An ensemble learning method that improves robustness and generalization through multiple decision trees.
3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A supervised learning model that finds optimal decision boundaries for classification tasks.
4. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: A deep learning model that automatically learns hierarchical features from the images.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances over the total instances.

## Results
- **CNN Accuracy**: 92%
- **KNN Accuracy**: 85%
- **Random Forests Accuracy**: 87%
- **SVM Accuracy**: 88%

The CNN model significantly outperformed the other models, demonstrating its effectiveness in fashion item recognition.

## Conclusion
This study highlights the potential of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks, in the field of fashion item recognition. While CNNs demand more computational resources and longer training times, their ability to automatically learn complex features leads to superior performance compared to traditional machine learning methods like KNN, Random Forests, and SVMs.
