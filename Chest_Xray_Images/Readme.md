# Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on the classification of chest X-ray images to detect pneumonia using deep learning techniques, specifically employing the VGG16 model. The dataset consists of chest X-ray images from pediatric patients, aimed at enhancing diagnostic accuracy in detecting pneumonia.

## Dataset Description
The dataset is organized into three folders:
- **train/**: Contains training images
- **test/**: Contains testing images
- **val/**: Contains validation images

Each folder includes subfolders for the two categories:
- **Pneumonia**
- **Normal**

### Dataset Statistics
- Total images: **5,863**
- Image format: JPEG
- Categories: **2** (Pneumonia/Normal)

The chest X-ray images were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients aged one to five years from the Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center. All imaging was performed as part of the patients' routine clinical care.

### Quality Control and Grading
For the analysis of chest X-ray images, all radiographs were initially screened for quality, removing any low-quality or unreadable scans. Diagnoses for the images were graded by two expert physicians, and to minimize grading errors, a third expert reviewed the evaluation set.

## Model Used
The project utilizes the **VGG16** model for classifying chest X-ray images into the categories of pneumonia and normal. VGG16 is known for its deep architecture and effective feature extraction capabilities, making it suitable for image classification tasks.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of deep learning in medical imaging, specifically focusing on the classification of pneumonia in chest X-ray images. By utilizing the VGG16 model, we aim to contribute to improving diagnostic processes and support healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.
