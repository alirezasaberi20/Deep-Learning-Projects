# Investigating GPT-4's Problem-Solving Capabilities in Verbal Insight Problems

## Abstract
This study investigates the problem-solving capabilities of **GPT-4** in verbal insight problems, comparing its performance with a human sample. A total of **30 problems**, categorized as "practice" and "transfer," were presented to GPT-4. Scoring involved assigning "0" for incorrect and "1" for correct responses. GPT-4 exhibited out-of-the-box thinking and performed comparably to human subjects, achieving a success rate aligned with the mean of the human sample. The study suggests GPT-4's potential in solving verbal insight problems, supported by its performance in practice and transfer problem sets. Additionally, the study utilized **Llama** in conjunction with GPT, enhancing the overall investigation.
